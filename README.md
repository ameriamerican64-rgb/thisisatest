# PurpleGlass AI Chat

A glossy, glassmorphic chat interface inspired by ChatGPT, dressed in luminous purples. This project is front-end only and does not connect to any API yet.

## Getting Started

## Features

- Glassmorphic shell with animated gradients and subtle lighting
- Responsive chat layout with assistant and user message styling
- Typing indicator with animated dots for simulated AI responses

## Customization Ideas
